## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup
```bash
# Backup current version
cp Aventa_HFT_Pro_2026_v7_3_3.py Aventa_HFT_Pro_2026_v7_3_3.backup
```

### Step 2: Verify Files
```
Files in workspace:
✅ Aventa_HFT_Pro_2026_v7_3_3.py (MODIFIED)
✅ SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md (NEW)
✅ QUICK_FIX_REFERENCE.md (NEW)
✅ BLOCKING_FIXES.md (NEW)
✅ PERFORMANCE_ROADMAP.md (NEW)
✅ All other files unchanged
```

### Step 3: Test
```bash
# Run the application
python Aventa_HFT_Pro_2026_v7_3_3.py

# Check for errors in output/logs
# Should see: "System ready. Configure and click START TRADING."
# Should NOT see any syntax/import errors
```

### Step 4: Deploy
```
1. Application is ready to use
2. Existing configs automatically load
3. No user retraining needed
4. All features work as before (but faster!)
```

## Rollback Procedure (if needed)

### If Any Issues:
```bash
# Simply restore backup
cp Aventa_HFT_Pro_2026_v7_3_3.backup Aventa_HFT_Pro_2026_v7_3_3.py
```

### Impact:
